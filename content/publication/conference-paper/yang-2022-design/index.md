abstract: Despite institutional and technological efforts to eradicate voice phishing, the number of cases of voice phishing has continued to increase over the past decade. This is because it is increasingly difficult for victims to distinguish between voice phishing and normal calls due to the diversification, intelligence, and sophistication of voice phishing techniques. Although there have been studies on techniques to detect voice phishing, the effectiveness of anti-voice phishing is still insufficient. Therefore, in this study, we propose a voice phishing prevention education scheme that will enhance the general public's cognitive awareness of voice phishing and help protect potential victims. We propose a voice phishing detection model trained with real and normal calling voices using deep learning-based KoBERT, a service that evaluates voice phishing risk and provides voice phishing prevention training content and countermeasures in case of damage.
