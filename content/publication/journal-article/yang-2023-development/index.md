abstract: Despite institutional and technological efforts to eradicate voice phishing, the number of cases of voice phishing has continuously increased over the past decade. This is because it has become increasingly difficult for victims to distinguish between voice phishing and normal calls due to the diversification, intelligence, and sophistication of voice phishing techniques. Although there are studies on techniques to detect voice phishing, the effectiveness of anti-voice phishing effectiveness is still inadequate. Therefore, in this study, along with a novel voice phishing prevention technique, we propose a voice phishing prevention education content that will enhance the voice phishing cognitive ability of the general public who can become potential victims. We have developed a voice phishing detection model that was trained by both the actual voice phishing call voice and the normal voice call voice, using deep learning-based KoBERT. Afterwards, we have developed a service that evaluates the voice phishing risk by analyzing the user"s call contents and provides voice phishing prevention education content and how to deal with it just in case of damage occurrence. We expect that our research development service will contribute to reducing the damage of voice phishing by enabling effective voice phishing detection and prevention education.
